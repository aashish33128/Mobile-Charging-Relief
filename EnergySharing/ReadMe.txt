##SOURCE CODE FOR PAPER Exploiting Peer-to-Peer Wireless Energy Sharing forMobile Charging Relief

## This application finds the maximum amount of times, a regular wall charging for a mobile user can be skipped 
##utilizing the energy from its peers.

##Follows Dynamic Programming Approach

##Instructions to run the code:

#Python/parseCSV.py: Run this file to extract necessary charging information (Charging cyles and discharging cycles) from the dataset.
#Change the location of the file as needed.

#Dataset used are haggle, cambridge and MIT.
#Some of the generated data are located in Data/ folder


#After data is generated, run ApplicationMain.java to run the algorithm.
#Few locations are hard-coded in the code. These should be changed as per requirements.

#output files are generated. Skip sequence and energy transferred can be viewed in generated OriginalOutput.csv file.
